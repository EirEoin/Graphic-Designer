## Design


### Fonts 

I chose to use Lato as the font for Sketchy Designs for a few reasons. Firstly, Lato is a clean and modern sans-serif font that is easy to read and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. It has a balanced and neutral appearance that makes it versatile enough to use across different sections of our webstore, from headings to body text. Overall, I believe that Lato's combination of readability, versatility, and accessibility make it an excellent choice for our e-commerce webstore.

### Colours 

I chose to use a simple black and white color scheme for our webstore because it provides a clean and timeless backdrop for our products and artwork. This color scheme is particularly well-suited for my project because the background is composed of previous artwork and as for say future goals, it will hopefully keep changing as new art is added in the future. By using black and white, we are able to create a neutral and versatile background that complements our colorful products and artwork perfectly. 

This allows our products to stand out and take center stage, without competing with a busy or distracting background.

It is easy to read and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring that our webstore is accessible and user-friendly for all customers.

# Agile Approach

Approaching this project, Sketchy Designs, there was a lot to. It was best I broke breaking it down into smaller manageable tasks and working on them incrementally. I created a project board with user stories attached to the GitHub repository to help keep track of the tasks and ensure that I was on track to meet the project goals. 
This approach allowed me to adapt to changes and make adjustments as needed, ensuring that the project was delivered on time and with the desired functionality. With this approach, I was able to prioritize what's important at different times to deliver a high-quality product that met the needs of the user. As this project was being built I even found myself adding to the project board and getting inspired with ideas on how this project could develop.

# SEO Implementation

When using SEO on this project i learned a few things. I learned The importance of keyword research: Keyword research is the process of identifying the words and phrases that people use when searching for products or services related to your business. By understanding these keywords, you can create content and optimize your website to rank higher in search results for relevant queries.
The role of on-page optimization: On-page optimization refers to the process of optimizing the content and structure of your website to make it more search engine friendly.
The value of high-quality content: High-quality content is an important factor in SEO, as search engines favor websites that provide valuable and relevant information to users. By creating high-quality content that is relevant to your target audience, you can improve your search engine rankings and attract more visitors to your website.

# Approach

Our B2C e-commerce approach to our graphic design webstore focuses on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing platform that is easy for customers to browse and purchase design services from. This would involve designing an intuitive website that showcases the different design services available, such as branding, marketing materials, and packaging, as well as providing clear and concise information about each service's features, benefits, and pricing.

Another important aspect of a B2C e-commerce graphic design webstore would be to create a strong online presence through marketing and social media. This could include creating engaging content, such as blog posts, tutorials, or case studies, and using social media platforms to reach a wider audience and drive traffic to the store. We focus on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing platform that makes it easy for customers to find and purchase the design services they need, while also building a strong online presence through marketing and social media efforts.

A feature we may have in the future would be to make the purchasing process as seamless as possible. This would involve providing multiple payment options, such as credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer, and offering fast and secure checkout. Additionally, it would be important to offer good customer service, including fast and helpful support for any questions or issues that may arise during the purchasing process.

# E-Commerce Business Model

* B2C - Online Retail Store                  
* Single Payment
* Selling Products

with these in mind we have to have a few other things too.
- Authentication  
- Easy Payment (STRIPE)  
- Cart  
- Product Description  
- Social Media Influence 


With Sketchy Designs I am taking a social media marketing approach using Instagram, Facebook and possibly TikTok.
Our Goals would be to find the right creative audience to grow and nurture our designs with.
Any type of Advertisement is going to be Low Cost.
Because of the Limits of how much an artist can produce, The price of work will grow with the demand. One thing we will never do as a business is under-perform. Long Waiting times or bad quality products ruin reputation. Customer Satisfaction is our priority.

* Payments

Payments will be securely processed using Stripe. To ensure secure payments I needed to implement proper security protocols such as an SSL certificate. An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certificate that provides a secure, encrypted connection between a web server and a web browser. It ensures that data transmitted between the two is private and secure.

To attract Consumers to my platform I will need to implement effective marketing strategies such as SEO, organic Social Media Marketing, some low cost paid Advertising and E-Mail marketing using MailChimp. 
Hopefully this Drives Traffic to Sketchy Designs and Increases Sales.

---

* Problem : Users cannot successfully complete the checkout process and receive an error message.
* Cause : There is a bug in the Stripe API integration.
* Solution ✅: The issue was identified by reviewing the Stripe API documentation and making adjustments to the API integration. The issue was fixed by ensuring the API key was correctly configured and that all necessary parameters were being passed to Stripe.

* Problem :  I was getting an error calling for Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined.
* Cause : This error is usually caused when the object on which a property or method is being accessed is not defined or null.

## Validator Testing

As a developer, I know how important it is to run tests and ensure that my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code is error-free and meets industry standards. That's why I always make sure to run my code through validators before launching a project. Validators are tools that check the syntax and structure of my code to make sure it is correct and follows best practices. For HTML and CSS, I use the W3C Validator, which checks my code against the latest standards and guidelines. For JavaScript, I use the JSLint and JSHint validators, which help me catch common mistakes and ensure that my code is clean and efficient. By running my code through these validators, I can be confident that my projects will be reliable and well-built, and that they will work seamlessly on any device or browser. Overall, running tests and using validators is an essential step in the development process and helps me deliver high-quality projects to my clients.

# Deployment

To deploy this site locally using VSCode IDE, you can use Heroku and Amazon S3 for hosting of static and media files. This allows the site to deplo automatically with commits to the master branch, and the code can also be run locally. Before starting, make sure you havethe following requirements installed: VScode IDE, Python v3.8 documentation, PIP package installer, an Stripe payment infastructure. 

To get started, clone a copy of the repository by clicking on the 'Code' button at the top of the page and selecting 'Download Zip'. Once downloaded, extract the files to your desired folder. Alternatively, if you have git installed on your client, you can run the following command from the terminal:

* git clone https://github.com/EirEoin/Graphic_Designer

Open up your local IDE, and ideally, create a virtual environment to allow all packages to be kept within the project. You can install this using the following command:

* pip install pipenv

In your root dir, create a new folder called '.venv' (ensure you have the .) To activate the virtual environment, navigate to the directory and run activate.bat. 

* [folderinstalled]\scripts\activate\activate.bat

If you're using Linux or Mac use the below command

* source .venv/bin/activate

Next we need to install all modules required by the project to run, use the following code 

* pipenv install -r requirements.txt

Create a new folder within the root dir called env.py. Within this file add the following lines to set up the environmental variables.

import os

---

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
|os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] | [Your Secret Key] |
|os.environ["DEV"] | 1 |
|os.environ["HOSTNAME"] | 0.0.0.0 |
|os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] | [Your Stripe Key] |
|os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"]  | [Your Stripe Secret Key] |
|os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] | [Your DB URL] |

---

## Database setup 

To set up your database you first need to run this command.

* python manage.py migrate

You're going to need a superuser to access the admin panel which you can creat using this command in the terminal.

* python manage.py createsuperuser

You should be able to run the server then using.

* python3 manage.py runserver 

If everything has been correctly configure you should not get a message giving you a link to your locally hosted site.
Next close the server in your terminal using ctrl+c (cmd+c on mac) and run the following commands to populate the database

* python manage.py loaddata 

---

# Deploying to Heroku 

To run this application in an online environment you will need to deploy the code to Heroku. Before moving on to this section please ensure you have followed the instructions for local deployment and this has been successful.

Either create an account at Heroku or log in to your account
Set up a new app under a unique name.
In the resources section, in the addons field type the below command and select the free cost option.

* heroku Postgres

Go to your settings tab and in the settings tab select Reveal Config Vars and copy the pre populated DATABASE_URL into your settings.py file in your project.
in the Config Vars in Heroku you will need to populate with the following keys

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | [your value] |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | [your value] |
| SECRET_KEY | [your value] |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | [your value] |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | [your value] |
| USE_AWS | [your value] |
| DATABASE_URL | [your value] |




Now this has been configured you will now migrate the local database to the cloud database using the migrate command as below

* python manage.py migrate

- Next you will need to create a super user and populate the database as described in the database set up section.
- when the migrations and data has been loaded, in your Heroku dashboard select Deploy tab.
- From here select the Github option and connect the repository from GitHub and select the branch (Master) to deploy from.
- It is advised to select automatic deployment to ensure for each push to Github the hosted version is up to date.
- When this has deployed select open app from the top bar of the Heroku App.

Overall, working with Heroku can be a rewarding experience, but it can also present some challenges, especially if you are new to the platform or working with unfamiliar technologies. By being prepared and willing to troubleshoot issues as they arise, you can successfully deploy your projects to Heroku and take advantage of its powerful features.
